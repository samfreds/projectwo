            Fire Walk with Me was created as a meditation on the overwhelming nature of contemporary web design.
            Clicking on a website, a user is instantly assaulted with information – browser cookies, paywall
            restrictions, email lists, pop-up advertisements…There’s no mystery, no intrigue, no drama. Out of this
            irritation, I came up with the idea: What if a website was shy? What if it was keeping a secret? What if you
            had to earn its trust? With these concepts in mind, I became inspired by the 90s murder-mystery television
            series Twin Peaks as the grounding story for the site. While I can’t explain the entire plot of Twin Peaks
            (nor could anyone else), generally it revolves around solving the murder of teenager Laura Palmer, whose
            secret diary contains clues about her killer.<br/><br/>
            Aesthetically, the site is quite minimalistic. There are two reasons for this. Firstly, I wanted the site to
            feel somewhat early-web and/or analog, reflecting the era in which the show was created. To achieve this, I
            used a pixelated, low-fi font that one might expect to see on one of those blocky white desktop computers. I
            also utilize ASCII art, a very common ornament in early web design. For the more analog moments, I added a
            handwritten script font you’d see in a diary, as well as images that are ripped and taped, giving them a
            more tangible feel. It is my hope that these choices give the site a sense of authenticity, that maybe Laura
            had coded the site herself, in hopes of keeping her secrets confidential after her untimely death. My second
            reason is simply that I love early web design. There is an element to it that is so naive and charming that
            I find irresistible. In an online world where everything is polished to the point of having no personality,
            I miss the novelty of glittery text and custom cursors and many many GIFs.<br/><br/>
            That said, I can admit that the site is limited in its current state. If I had weeks, perhaps even months to
            continue coding, I would love for the puzzle to be longer and more complicated. Questions that are harder to
            answer, perhaps secret buttons one must find in order to navigate to the next page, and then a more
            elaborate pop-up display at the very end to reward one’s effort. A diary is a very private thing, so it
            would only be right for the process of gaining the website’s trust to take significant time.<br/><br/>
            Though an ideal user would be familiar with the series in order to navigate through the site’s “obstacles,”
            the questions can be answered with the help of Google if need be. And while a user unfamiliar with the
            series might not understand some of the visual references, I hope they would be fascinated by Laura’s story
            regardless. Like any mystery, the fun lies not in the uncovering of the truth, but the steps one takes to
            get there. So embrace your inner Dale Cooper, Nancy Drew, Philip Marlowe, etc., and give it a try.
